			<p class="titletext">Election of 1976<p>
		</div>
		<div class="words">
			<p class="wordstext">Richard Nixon was finishing out his last year as President with a Democratic Senate and House when the 1976 Democratic Primary began. This was a hotly contested primary, the party having no clear successor to Johnson after the massive unpopularity of Vietnam and the failures of Hubert Humphrey and George McGovern to beat Nixon. Additionally, this was the very first primary where every state would have a say in the Democratic Nominee. The candidates who got the most votes in this race were Alabama Governor George Wallace, California Governor Jerry Brown, and Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter. Most candidates believed the South to be unwinnable with the staunch segregationist Wallace in the race, and largely gave up on the region. However, Carter campaigned there extensively as a more moderate candidate. When Wallace came up with humiliating defeats in many early states, Carter was able to sweep much of the South while also building a coalition of Christian moderates in the North, winning just under 40% of the vote and the Democratic Nomination. This broad coalition was remarked upon by the New York Times, Wicker writing, “Any independent observer must concede that the most remarkable fact of the 1976 campaign so far is Jimmy Carter's demonstrated ability to appeal virtually all across the spectrum of Democratic voters.”<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1976/03/28/archives/the-carter-coalition.html">[1]</a> Carter announced Mondale as his running mate shortly before the Democratic convention, and began positioning himself as an outsider to Washington. He emphasized a religious message and to specifically contrast with Nixon, often brought up his focus on honesty in government. However, this honesty occasionally backfired, including in one infamous playboy interview: “I've looked on a lot of women with lust. I've committed adultery in my heart many times”<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1976/09/23/archives/carters-comments-on-sex-cause-concern.html">[2]</a>. His great lead over Ford was slowly eroded, with the winner being uncertain on election night. However, Carter carried a narrow victory over Ford.<p>

			<p class="titletext">First 100 Days<p>
		</div>
		<div class="words">
			<p class="wordstext">In his inaugural address, Carter said he aimed to make the government more “competent and compassionate”<a href="https://www.whitehousehistory.org/bios/jimmy-carter">[3]</a>. The very same day, he issued an executive order giving unconditional amnesty for every Vietnam War draft evader. Again flexing his executive authority, he began to make changes to the cabinet, splitting the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in two. However, many of these actions began to reveal to Carter the limits of what an “outsider” president can do in Washington. One Democrat said of Carter that he was “an engineer without deep philosophic roots and hence without an instinctive way of orienting himself on issues”<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UOR51CQ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1">[4]</a>. Being an “outsider” to Washington, a message that very possibly made the difference between winning and losing, now prevented Carter from passing much of the policy and reform that he wished to. He often fought with Speaker of the House Tip O’ Neil, despite being from the same party. The first one hundred days of every president since Roosevelt have been emphasized, as that is when most presidents pass their most sweeping reforms. Carter, however, accomplished astonishingly little during his first one hundred days because of his inability to work with Congress and his refusal to play the political game.<p>

			<p class="titletext">Midterms<p>
		</div>
		<div class="words">
			<p class="wordstext"> The 1978 Midterm Elections were among the best midterm elections for the party of any newly elected president. The Democrats lost only two seats in the Senate and fifteen in the House of Representatives. However, this does not mean the election outcome was necessarily good for Carter. Carter’s troubles working with Congress did not end with these midterms, evidenced by his “Hit List”. He put forward 17 projects he believed to be unimportant and government bloat, vowing to veto any bill which would renew them, believing to have enough support in the House. However, this massively backfired, with his support dropping out and him soon signing into law many of the projects on his “Hit List”, a massive show of weakness. A New York Times article on the subjects demonstrates why this is resulting from his lack of Washington knowledge: “For years the Department of the Interior has been known as the Department of Wink, as in ‘The regulations are such and such but [wink, wink] you go right ahead.’ Overgrazing, overcutting and unbridled mining were some of the results. Under Cecil D. Andrus, Secretary of the Interior, the winking has stopped, but then the crackdown on grazing rights and economic exploitation only angers whole new groups —rancheis, timber interests and miners.”<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/14/archives/under-the-big-sky-shadows-of-paranoia.html">[5]</a>. The midterm elections spelled the end for most of Carter’s domestic agenda, leaving him seen as an incredibly weak and ineffectual president.<p>

		<div class="title">
			<p class="titletext">Foreign Policy<p>
		</div>
		<div class="words">
			<p class="wordstext">Similarly to his predecessor, after Carter could no longer pass any new domestic legislation, he began engaging quite substantially with Foreign Policy. However, unlike Nixon, he did so far less publicly—possibly also a sign of his lack of political prowess, or perhaps an indicator that he understood just how abhorrent his actions were at times. One of the ongoing crises when Carter won the election was the invasion and genocide in East Timor by Indonesia. Ford kept the American arms sales to Indonesia just as they were prior to the invasion, but by the time Carter was in office they were beginning to run low on munitions. According to an article published in the World Policy Journal, “U.S. arms sales hit $112 million in 1978, and averaged nearly $60 million per year for the four years of the Carter administration — this was more than twice the level of weaponry supplied to the Suharto regime by the Ford Administration. During a visit to Jakarta in May, 1978, Vice President Walter Mondale offered to sell Indonesia 16 A-4 ‘Skyhawk’ attack planes, a principle counterinsurgency aircraft that was used by US forces in Vietnam and is capable of spraying weapons fire and explosives over wide areas.”<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170226181104/http://www.worldpolicy.org/projects/arms/reports/indoarms.html">[6]</a>. Despite promising honesty and openness in government at home, he did not give the same considerations to his actions abroad, especially not when his actions were in support of a genocidal government. American attention soon turned to Iran however, as the Shah was ruling over great unrest. He had been diagnosed with cancer and was spending great amounts of time in private and in the West seeking medical help. However, because of his absence during the great unrest, his dictatorship was beginning to crumble. In 1978 outright revolt broke out in many of the major Iranian cities, with everyone from Communists to Liberals to Islamists revolting. The Shah was overthrown in 1979, and Ayatollah Khomeini was put in place as the Supreme Leader of Iran. The American Embassy was occupied by the new regime, with the hostages inside being the spark point of the Iranian Hostage Crisis. Jimmy Carter attempted to both negotiate the release of the hostages and rescue them, all ending in failure. This hostage crisis would become one of the most important issues in the 1980 election, as well as the ensuing Oil Crisis.<p>

			<p class="titletext">Oil Crisis<p>
		</div>
		<div class="words">
			<p class="wordstext"> Although the Iranian Revolution caused oil production to drop only marginally, the new fears present in the western world caused oil prices to skyrocket. Jimmy Carter was broadly blamed for the oil crisis, and more justly blamed for a poor handling of it. One of the most unpopular policies implemented by certain states was a system of “Odd-even” rationing, in which gas could only be purchased on odd days with an odd license plate, and the same being true for even days and plates. Only further worsening the crisis, Carter attempted to make a show of strength by issuing an embargo against all Iranian Oil imports. Oil producers in OPEC made record profits due to this panic, with revenue going up nearly 100% in certain instances.<p>

			<p class="titletext">Election of 1980<p>
		</div>
		<div class="words">
			<p class="wordstext"> In the lead up to the election of 1980, Jimmy Carter was far in the lead of any of the three Republican candidates. Very quickly Ronald Reagan emerged as the front runner over Bush or Anderson, after his failed run in 1976. According to Gallup Polls, in March Carter led Reagan by 15%<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/110548/gallup-presidential-election-trialheat-trends-19362004.aspx#4">[7]</a>. However, as time went on, the American People began to sour on Carter. There are the often brought up topics of the Oil Crisis and the Iranian Hostage Crisis, but there is one far less tangible factor that caused Carter to lose the election. Carter was not so much a politician as a technocrat and an engineer. According to Leuchtenburg’s In the Shadow of FDR, “He did not promise to excite us or entertain us or even lead us in the public fashion of a Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, or Lyndon B. Johnson. He promised only to manage our affairs sensibly and with a degree of charity. We in turn responded, and so elected the country’s first national manager”. When Carter told the American people to wear a sweater rather than heat their homes, he was seen as cold, out of touch, and generally not a friendly face. Reagan symbolized the exact polar opposite of this. He was a well liked actor, spoke calmly and warmly, and promised, untruthfully so, much more than Carter did. Although Carter was more honest with America during this election, straight honesty was never desired, but someone who instead gave the impression of honesty. Jimmy Carter was a competent policy maker, a competent manager, and more honest than likely any other modern President. But, he was not warm. He was not a politician. He had no ability to lie to the public and make extravagant promises in flowery speeches rooted in the history and ideology that made Reagan’s rhetoric so appealing. Overall, Carter may have been a better choice than Reagan, and he was incredibly ill-prepared to convince people of his worth.<p>
